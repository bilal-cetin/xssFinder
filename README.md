# xssFinder
There is a lots of tools better than  xssFinder. But as far as I can see, the tools written on XSS try to get something with brute-force through a wordlist with payloads. 
Here, we check the critical characters instead of the wordlist and if the result is positive, “We Found XSS!” "Highly Probable of Being XSS!"
